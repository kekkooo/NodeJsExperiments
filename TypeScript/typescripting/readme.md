# My Node Js Experiments

I wanted to experiment with NodeJs and the MEAN stack
(but also with some other frameworks, such as React or BackBone).
I also wanted to learn Javascript and Typescript. 

### Folders
For now there is just the NodeSchool folder, since I started from there
(without no prior knowledge of Javascript or Typescript).
The folders Javascript and Typescript will contain my solutions to 
the NodeSchool tutorials given in the two languages.
